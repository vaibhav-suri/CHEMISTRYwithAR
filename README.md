Augmented Reality based application to literally play around with atoms ,form compounds and know more about them.

**INTRODUCTION**

Most of us can relate how hard Chemistry can be to properly visualise and learn. Students often see learning reactions as a burden and
hate the subject.We aim to incorporate Augmented Reality in the realm of Chemistry.Students would literally be playing around with ATOMS,
forming compounds and knowing more about them.
